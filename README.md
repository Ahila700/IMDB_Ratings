# IMDB_Ratings
___

I wanted to be able to find the best rated shows on imdb for myself that fit into categories that I was specifically looking for. Mainly something with more of an overarching story. So i grabbed data on everything from IMDB and am working to sort through it to avoid genres such as documentary series, sitcoms, reality TV etc and find the best shows and movies in those areas.

Using SQL to query different results and the data from all the different shows and movies from the IMDB database I was able to query a list of the movies that fit the descriptions I was looking to get.
